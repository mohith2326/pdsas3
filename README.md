c)In this analysis, we focused on blood pressure statistics and generated 500 samples, each consisting of 150 observations, from the diabetic population dataset using bootstrap resampling. We discovered that the bootstrap method yields stable estimates for the mean, standard deviation, and the 90th percentile of blood pressure when we compared the original population metrics with the averages derived from the bootstrap samples. The comparison charts demonstrate the consistency of the resampled data with the original population, providing visual evidence of the blood pressure statistics' dependability across different samples. This method improves our comprehension of the population's major blood pressure measurements' resilience.
